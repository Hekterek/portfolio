    <h2>Me and the code</h2>
    <p>Hello! <br><br>

        I'm Karol, a person who has been drawn into the world of IT and who doesn't
        want to leave it. <br><br>

        For some time now, I've found what I was looking for in the field of computer
        science - the ability to create new things and to be free. And programming is
        precisely what gives me that.

        I started my journey with the front end and without hesitation, I quickly got to
        know the fundamental principles of coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        Writing code on this side gives me the opportunity to beautifully present
        content to future users in a clean, clear, and very intuitive way. <br><br>

        But knowing only the front end, I had a feeling as if I were living with just one
        hand. Then it was time for the back end.

        Since Java fell into my hands, I felt like a omnipotent person. From that moment on,
        I can gradually and precisely create whatever I want.

        With such possibilities, I immediately started writing my project that will help
        many people deal with managing their finances. More about that in another tab ! <br><br>

        The only problem with programming is that the more we delve into different
        technologies, the hungrier we become for new ways and possibilities that these
        technologies offer us. <br><br>

        It's not a problem, it's a side effect ! </p>

            “Each of you, my young friends, will find in life some personal "Westerplatte."
            Some measure of tasks that have to be undertaken and fulfilled. Some rightful cause
            for which one cannot avoid fighting. Some duty, or necessity, which one cannot shun.
            From which one cannot desert. Finally, some order of truths and values that must be
            maintained and defended, just like Westerplatte. Maintain and defend, in yourself and
            around you, defend for yourself and for others.”
